ðŸ§± Low-Level Design Problems
Welcome! This repository contains a curated list of Low-Level Design (LLD) problems I've solved to sharpen my system design skills and object-oriented programming principles. These exercises simulate real-world systems with a focus on clean architecture, extensibility, and maintainability.

ðŸ“Œ Highlights
âœ… SOLID principles applied

âœ… Modular and testable code

âœ… Design patterns: Singleton, Strategy, Observer, Factory, etc.

âœ… Emphasis on scalability and clarity

âœ… Unit tested where applicable
