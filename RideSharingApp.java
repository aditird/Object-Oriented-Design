/*
IMPORTANT POINTS

To handle concurrent ride requests, I would first ensure that the driver assignment
logic is thread-safe to avoid race conditions. For instance, I could use
a distributed lock (e.g., using Zookeeper or Redis) to ensure that a driver is
not assigned to multiple rides simultaneously.

On the database side, I would implement partitioning to handle large-scale reads and writes efficiently.
For real-time scalability, the system would use microservices, with each service independently deployed and scaled.
For example, a dedicated Ride Service would handle ride requests, while a Driver Service would manage driver availability.
 Communication between these services would be facilitated using a message queue like Kafka to ensure smooth processing
 under heavy load.

 To integrate real-time location tracking, I would use WebSockets for continuous communication between the server and
  the driver/rider apps. This ensures low-latency updates for both parties. On the backend, I would store driver locations
  in a Redis instance with geo-spatial indexing, allowing the system to quickly find the nearest drivers.

The frontend would use a library like Google Maps to visualize movement, with driver locations updated based on deltas
 rather than full coordinates to minimize bandwidth usage. This system could also integrate alerts for nearby drivers
 when a new ride request is initiated.

 To make the design extensible, I would use modular interfaces like PricingStrategy and RideType. For example, PricingStrategy
 could have implementations for flat-rate pricing, time-based pricing, and surge pricing, which can be swapped dynamically. For r
 ide-sharing, I would extend the Ride class to a SharedRide class that maintains a list of riders and implements logic for
 splitting fares and matching destinations.

To incorporate driver preferences, the Driver class would have fields like preferredDistance and preferredRiderTypes.
These preferences would be factored into the driver-matching algorithm, making it more personalized. Finally, Iâ€™d use
feature toggles to roll out these changes incrementally, ensuring smooth adoption.
